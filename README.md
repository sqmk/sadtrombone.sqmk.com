## sadtrombone.us Website

This is the entire contents of the website, http://sadtrombone.us.

The only thing that is not included is the nginx config. You can find that in the wiki.

## What is it for?

Conveying sadness in a URL that is:

* Broken
* Contains some kind of mistake
* Immoral
* Insert your reasoning for using the site here

## Why?

I needed a reason to own a .us TLD.

## Issues?

The iframe loading will work on nearly all sites except those that use:

* JS to break out of frames
* Pass X-Frame-Options deny header
* Don't actually exist

Finding a workaround for these things is evil.

Also, it's HTML5. Modern browsers only.

## Inspiration

I like http://bacolicio.us. I like funny things.
