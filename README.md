## sadtrombone.sqmk.com Website

This is the entire contents of the website, http://sadtrombone.sqmk.com.

## What is it for?

Conveying sadness in a URL that is:

* Broken
* Contains some kind of mistake
* Immoral
* Insert your reasoning for using the site here

## Why?

I wanted a .at domain. I purchased sadtrombone.at. It was expensive. I no longer have an .at domain.

I switched to a .us domain. I never owned a .us domain. They are cheap. I purchased sadtrombone.us. However, .us domains aren't very cool.

Cheaped out, and now running as a github page using my coveted 4 letter domain name.

## Issues?

The iframe loading will work on nearly all sites except those that use:

* JS to break out of frames
* Pass X-Frame-Options deny header
* Don't actually exist

Finding a workaround for these things is evil.

Also, it's HTML5. Modern browsers only.

## Inspiration

I like http://bacolicio.us. I like funny things.
